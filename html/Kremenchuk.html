        <h3><b><i>General information</i></b></h3>
        <hr>
        <p><b><i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremenchuk>Kremenchuk</a></i></b> is an industrial city in central Ukraine which stands on the banks of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper">Dnieper River</a></i>. The city serves as the administrative center of Kremenchuk Raion and Kremenchuk urban hromada within <i>Poltava Oblast</i>. Its population is approximately 215,271 (2022 estimate), ranking 31st in Ukraine. In 2001, the Ukrainian government included the city in the list of historical settlements.</p>
        <p>Although not as large as some oblast centers, Kremenchuk has a large industrial center in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. A KrAZ truck plant, the Kremenchuk Oil Refinery of Ukrtatnafta, the Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works, and Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Power Plant, in nearby Svitlovodsk, are located in or near Kremenchuk. Highway M22 crosses the Dnieper over the dam of the power plant.</p>
        <p>Kremenchuk was founded in 1571 as a fortress. The name Kremenchuk is explained as deriving from the word "kremen" - flint (a mineral) because the city is located on a giant chert plate. An alternative explanation says that "Kremenchuk" is the Turkish for "small fortress".</p>
